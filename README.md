This page is dedicated to cats using data and images from The Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/).

I started this project to learn and practice, especially async JavaScript, and refresh and extend my Bootstrap knowledge a bit.

It started out as a bunch of HTML and JS files all working nicely locally, then I realised that if I wanted to make the page online, I would expose my API key with that setup.
This started my journey with Netlify. After long hours, I succeeded, and my page is up and running! :)

Next step: improving search, making keyboard navigation possible.
